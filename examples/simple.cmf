> @alice: Can you explain the setup steps?
# Setup Guide

Yes! Here are the **essential steps** for getting started:

## 1. Environment Setup

First you need to set up your environment. Install the following dependencies:

| Tool | Version | Required |
|------|---------|----------|
| Rust | 1.70+ | Yes |
| Node.js | 18+ | Optional |
| Make | 4.0+ | Yes |

## 2. Installation

Here's the basic installation command:

```bash
curl https://install.example.com/setup.sh | bash
cargo build --release
```

Second, note that assistant messages can be **multi-paragraph** and support _markdown formatting_.

 > This is an assistant blockquote (indented to avoid being parsed as a user line).

## 3. Configuration

Create a config file with your settings:

```rust
let config = Config {
    debug: false,
    timeout: 30,
    retries: 3,
};
```

> @bob: Is there a quick start example?
Absolutely! Here's a **minimal example** to get you running in seconds:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

You can run it with `cargo run`. Make sure you have **Rust 1.70 or later** installed.

| Step | Command | Time |
|------|---------|------|
| Build | cargo build | ~30s |
| Test | cargo test | ~10s |
| Deploy | cargo release | ~60s |
